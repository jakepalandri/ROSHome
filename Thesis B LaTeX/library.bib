   abstract = {Gesture recognition has been an attractive area of research since a long time. With the introduction of Microsoft Kinect, hand gesture and body gesture recognition has become handy for the researchers. Here an innovative application has been presented which controls all electrical home appliances through hand gestures. The algorithm presented here is an assistive application useful for physically challenged and senior citizens. In this paper we have used Microsoft Kinect for image capturing along with some important computer vision (CV) and digital image processing techniques (DIP) for hand gesture recognition. Arduino Uno microcontroller and relay circuits are used for controlling electrical devices. The algorithm presented gives an accuracy of 88 %.},

   abstract = {Unusual changes in the regular daily mobility routine of an elderly person at home can be an indicator or early symptom of developing health problems. Sensor technology can be utilised to complement the traditional healthcare systems to gain a more detailed view of the daily mobility of a person at home when performing everyday tasks. We hypothesise that data collected from low-cost sensors such as presence and occupancy sensors can be analysed to provide insights on the daily mobility habits of the elderly living alone at home and to detect routine changes. We validate this hypothesis by designing a system that automatically learns the daily room-to-room transitions and permanence habits in each room at each time of the day and generates alarm notifications when deviations are detected. We present an algorithm to process the sensors’ data streams and compute sensor-driven features that describe the daily mobility routine of the elderly as part of the developed Behaviour Monitoring System (BMS). We are able to achieve low detection delay with confirmation time that is high enough to convey the detection of a set of common abnormal situations. We illustrate and evaluate BMS with synthetic data, generated by a developed data generator that was designed to mimic different user’s mobility profiles at home, and also with a real-life dataset collected from prior research work. Results indicate BMS detects several mobility changes that can be symptoms of common health problems. The proposed system is a useful approach for learning the mobility habits at the home environment, with the potential to detect behaviour changes that occur due to health problems, and therefore, motivating progress toward behaviour monitoring and elder’s care.},

The products available in the market are not designed to make difference to the life of the disabled and the old age population of the world. The disabled and aged people have become grounded in life to perform everyday tasks even after technological advancements. This affects physical health and hygiene in addition to mental depression. In the market, few products are available targeting the aged and the disabled population. In smart home automation, using wearables made a major impact on the quality of life of the disabled and aged population. The smart home automation features automatic opening/closing of the doors, object/face recognition, and switching on/off lights, without moving from a place to the target location. Various technologies are available to build automation features to manage everyday tasks independently and to improve the quality of life of disabled and aged people. This chapter focuses on various technologies available for smart automation to support the needy population of the world, from the perspective of wearables. This chapter also discusses the development of gesture-based home automation and security for visually impaired people and old age people.},

   abstract = {Could we use Computer Vision in the Internet of Things for using pictures as sensors? This is the principal hypothesis that we want to resolve. Currently, in order to create safety areas, cities, or homes, people use IP cameras. Nevertheless, this system needs people who watch the camera images, watch the recording after something occurred, or watch when the camera notifies them of any movement. These are the disadvantages. Furthermore, there are many Smart Cities and Smart Homes around the world. This is why we thought of using the idea of the Internet of Things to add a way of automating the use of IP cameras. In our case, we propose the analysis of pictures through Computer Vision to detect people in the analysed pictures. With this analysis, we are able to obtain if these pictures contain people and handle the pictures as if they were sensors with two possible states. Notwithstanding, Computer Vision is a very complicated field. This is why we needed a second hypothesis: Could we work with Computer Vision in the Internet of Things with a good accuracy to automate or semi-automate this kind of events? The demonstration of these hypotheses required a testing over our Computer Vision module to check the possibilities that we have to use this module in a possible real environment with a good accuracy. Our proposal, as a possible solution, is the analysis of entire sequence instead of isolated pictures for using pictures as sensors in the Internet of Things.},

   abstract = {In-house video surveillance to control the safety of people living in domestic environments is considered. In this context, common problems and general purpose computer vision techniques are discussed and implemented in an integrated solution comprising a robust moving object detection module which is able to disregard shadows, a tracking module designed to handle large occlusions, and a posture detector. These factors, shadows, large occlusions and people's posture, are the key problems that are encountered with in-house surveillance systems. A distributed system with cameras installed in each room of a house can be used to provide full coverage of peoples movements. Tracking is based on a probabilistic approach in which the appearance and probability of occlusions are computed for the current camera and warped in the next camera's view by positioning the cameras to disambiguate the occlusions. The application context is the emerging area of domotics (from the Latin word damus, meaning 'home', and informatics). In particular, indoor video surveillance, which makes it possible for elderly and disabled people to live with a sufficient degree of autonomy, via interaction with this new technology, which can be distributed in a house at affordable costs and with high reliability. © IEE, 2005.},

Process of identifying intrusions is achieved by our Smart Intruder Detection and Surveillance System (SIDSS) which involves 3 stages of computer vision algorithms. 3-stage SIDSS includes an optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) for threat and intrusion detections, cascading classifiers for locating any potential intruders with correcting mechanism to overcome undetected threats from the previous stage, and principal component analysis (PCA) to efficiently train the facial recognizer to accurately differentiate passersby from potential intruders. Our system is scalable for various surveillance events and can be expanded with additional pre-processed datasets added to the SIDSS model to manage greater surveillance areas. Through this enhanced configuration, the system can achieve enhanced accuracy of recognizing broad range of weapons used and intruders.},

This study on computer vision for elderly care is based on a Microsoft Kinect sensor considers an inexpensive, three dimensional, non-contact technique, that is comfortable for patients while being highly reliable and suitable for long term monitoring. This paper proposes a hand gesture system for elderly health care based on deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) that is used to extract features and to classify five gestures according to five categories using a support vector machine (SVM). The proposed system is beneficial for elderly patients who are voiceless or deaf-mute and unable to communicate with others. Each gesture indicates a specific request such as “Water”, “Meal”, “Toilet”, “Help” and “Medicine” and translates as a command sending to a Microcontroller circuit that sends the request to the caregiver’s mobile phone via the global system for mobile communication (GSM). The system was tested in an indoor environment and provides reliable outcomes and a useful interface for older people with disabilities in their limbs to communicate with their families and caregivers.},
