Existing smart home software

Problems with existing solutions 
- Motion detection for lighting
    - Any object moving causes lights to turn on, not just people
    - If you are watching TV and you move the lights turn on

Solutions
- With the Kinect camera and some AI 
    - We can detect if it is a person moving
    - We can detect if the person is still seated

- I want to implement a web interface as well
    - Reasoning:
        - I think it will provide more for the thesis
        - I am a strong believer that we should not replace existing functionality
            - But we should develop on TOP of it
        - We should not replace the ability to open blinds or turn lights on and off manually
            - We should add the option to be able to control them regularly
        - Technology is not fool-proof (YET) so we must cater to potential failures


# PROBLEMS WITH EXISTING SMART HOMES
https://reolink.com/blog/smart-home-frequent-issues/#4-automation-and-routine-failures
- Interoperability
    - Devices operating on different protocols cannot communicate
- Lack of true "intelligence" in a "smart" home
    - Smart devices are actually dumb
    - At best, they follow timers or simple algorithms
    - AI implementation makes smart devices truly smart
- Requirement for internet connection
    - Many devices require an internet connection to operate
    - Computation and automation running should all be done locally to solve this
- Automation and routine failure
    - Devices
- Privacy and Cyber security risks
    - Solved by having local computation


# Thesis C TODOs
- [x] Timing commands with gestures
- [x] Alternative interpretations of speech for commands
- [x] Response when command not recognised
- [x] Wake word
- [ ] Pattern matching for commands
- [x] User can upload their own commands

# Report
- Future plan

- Appendix:
    - user manual
    - how to use, etc.
    - extensive detail on setup and running
