# Thesis A
## Lit Review (12-15 pages)

### Brief background (2 pages) - Wednesday
- history
- contextualise importance
    - revolutionises daily living, will set new standards for accessibility
    - free up time (ask chatgpt for a list of benefits/how can smart home technologies revolutionise) 
    - if going through history, ensure that it is in reference to the importance of the smarthome, or parallels in significance

### Summary of existing literature (6-8 pages) - Half Wednesday / Half Thursday
- Smart Environment
- Robotics
- Person tracking
- 3D tracking
- Behaviour monitoring
- ROS - outline and relevance
- Theory and principles behind it, not description

### Literature gaps (3 pages) - Half Wednesday / Half Thursday
lack of computer vision used in homes and home automation
using AI for people tracking, gesture recogniction and behavioural predictive automation - lack of proper foundational knowledge, further innovate

### Problem statement (1 page) - Friday
based on literature gaps
summary of what you aim to do and investigate

### Aims and outcomes (1 page) - Friday
check canva or notes

## Project Plan (5-7 pages)

### Methodology and approach (3 pages) - Friday
- Decompose the whole project into multiple components
- Explain the functions of each component and how you would tackle each component
    - Tech stack slide?
    - Breakdown of aims and outcomes
        - What I plan to achieve across Thesis A, B and C
            - Later is what I acutally achieved in Thesis A
    - Some of this info is on timeline slide (Canva)

### Timeline for Thesis B and C (1 page) - Saturday
- In terms of weeks is enough detail
    - This will highly likely change over time
- Justification of time allocation for each component

### Required training and upskilling identified (2 pages) - Saturday
- What will I have to learn for the ENTIRE project
    - ROS
    - Yolo
    - AI and Machine Learning
    - etc

## Project Dependent Preparations (1-2 pages)

### Can the student achieve the aims in the timeline for Thesis B and Thesis C? What progress has been made already? (1-2 pages) - Saturday
- Progress
- Roadblocks
- Tech Stack
- Images of demo
- Explaining how demo and tests prove viability of project
    - Able to take 3D camera input and control devices

- Project specific, but may include
    - Evidence of some upskilling (new programming languages, software, tools, project-specific knowledge required before taking Thesis Ba)
    - Preliminary results

## Document Presentation - Saturday
- Report structure and layout
- English skills â€“ spelling, grammar
- Figures
- Clarity of writing
- Citations consistent and correctly formatted

# Thesis C
# Abstract
## Introduction
## Literature Review
- Copy + paste literature review from Thesis A
- Update existing literature review
    - Voice commands, etc.
## Methodology
- Talk about ROS and how devices interface, speech tools, models etc.
## Evaluation
- Incl. photos
- What worked and what didn't?
## Conclusion and Future Work
- How to improve
- Extension work
    - Implementing typeless voice commands with stored locations of devices
    - Implementing specific locations with vectors from gestures (not just walls)
    - Have commands from MQTT automatically trigger a command on Home Assistant end
        - Send command such as light.ceiling.turn_on
    - Pose Recognition for in the dark
    - More advanced commands to include variables such as a brightness level to set a light to
- What would you do differently?
